### Project Proposal:

1. **Chosen Dataset:** **Chosen Dataset:** [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (stock data), [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) (transaction data)
2. **Application Name:** Financial Tracker
3. **Project Topic/Objective:** The objective of my application is to dive into data and extract information regarding stocks or transaction data. It would be interesting to see how money has flowed over time or what industries have changed. I have not delved into the API, but I'm assuming I will have to drop that data into an SQL repository and aggregate it. I would like to see which stocks have taken a nose dive or which have had a complete turn around. Also, pinning stocks or money flows would be interesting with historical events.
4. **Motivation:** This project is interesting to me because I enjoy Financial stories or how certain businesses make changes to overcome problems to their bottom line. Often times, money is power and getting a complete picture of events can tell a great story. A lot of times financial situations can become political and influence policy in government and it's not always handled correctly. I love how the fed approaches situations and how their methods have changed in our global environment.
